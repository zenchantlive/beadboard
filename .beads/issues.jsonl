This epic represents a fundamental shift in how BeadBoard handles historical context. We explicitly rejected the traditional 'Event Sourcing' model which requires a separate, mutable database. Instead, we implemented a 'Derived Event' architecture. In this model, the system's history is not stored but computed. By performing high-performance, memory-resident diffs between sequential snapshots of the issues.jsonl source of truth, we generate a rich social timeline that is mathematically guaranteed to be 100% consistent with the underlying git-backed Beads. This ensures that the 'Storytelling' layer of the application never drifts from the 'Authority' layer.

The heart of the implementation is the O(N) snapshot-differ algorithm, which we performance-tuned to handle project scales of 200+ beads with sub-10ms latency. A significant 'Dark Moment' occurred during development when we realized Next.js Hot Module Replacement (HMR) was purging our in-memory activity ring buffer, effectively wiping the project's history on every code save. We solved this by implementing a persistence layer in src/lib/activity-persistence.ts that mirrors the buffer to a file-backed store at .beadboard/activity.json.
