## Regime Strategies

### Mixed Choppy

**Recommended approach** (93% confidence, seen 1x):
> Reduce or eliminate trading. In mixed markets (BNB +0.93%, SOL +1.65%, BTC -0.08%, ETH -0.03%, DOGE -1.19%), zero-trade strategies ($0 PnL) outperformed all active traders (all negative PnL). Trade frequency inversely correlates with performance: 0 trades = $0, 2 trades = -$0.29, 160 trades = -$17.96, 201 trades = -$360.24.

- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (93% confidence, seen 1x):
> Zero trading or extremely low frequency (<25 trades/24h). Market showed BNB +2.03%, ETH +1.02%, DOGE +1.07%, BTC +0.24% but all active traders lost money. Only non-traders preserved capital. If trading, long-only on strongest performers (BNB).
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (92% confidence, seen 1x):
> Zero trading or very low frequency (<30 trades/24h) with long-only bias. Market up +0.63% to +2.15% across all assets - passive strategies outperformed all active traders. Only skill_only_oss with 89 trades and selective longs achieved positive PnL.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (90% confidence, seen 1x):
> Avoid shorting entirely. All short-biased strategies lost money despite 'bearish' technical signals. Technical indicators gave false bearish readings in a bullish regime.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (90% confidence, seen 1x):
> Avoid shorting entirely. skill_aware_oss lost $-167.78 with 171 trades including BTCUSDT shorts despite 'bearish alignment' signals. Market direction trumps technical signals.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bearish

**Recommended approach** (88% confidence, seen 1x):
> Trade frequency inversely correlates with performance: 0-10 trades = $0 to -$30 loss; 76-103 trades = -$44 to -$180 loss. Optimal is <20 trades or pure capital preservation.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-16

### Mixed Choppy

**Recommended approach** (88% confidence, seen 1x):
> Technical analysis signals (multi-timeframe alignment, MACD, SMA crossovers) generate false signals in mixed markets. Both bullish and bearish aligned trades lost money.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (88% confidence, seen 1x):
> Asset selection critical: BNB (+2.03%) significantly outperformed SOL (-0.09%). Agents focusing on SOL longs (llama4_scout) lost heavily despite 'uptrend' reasoning.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bearish

**Recommended approach** (85% confidence, seen 1x):
> Reduce trade frequency dramatically or avoid trading entirely. Zero-trade strategies ($0 PnL) outperformed active trading strategies (avg -$66 PnL). Only agentic_gptoss profited by actively managing shorts and closing positions to lock gains.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-16

### Mixed Choppy

**Recommended approach** (85% confidence, seen 1x):
> If trading, prefer assets showing clear directional movement (SOL +1.65%, BNB +0.93%) over flat assets (BTC -0.08%, ETH -0.03%). Avoid shorting in mixed regimes even with bearish technical signals.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (85% confidence, seen 1x):
> Asset selection: BNB (+2.15%) significantly outperformed BTC (+0.63%). Long positions in higher-beta assets would have captured more upside.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (85% confidence, seen 1x):
> Technical analysis signals (multi-timeframe alignment, MACD, RSI) are unreliable for direction. Both bullish and bearish technical signals led to losses.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-17

### Moderate Bearish

**Recommended approach** (82% confidence, seen 1x):
> Short positions with active profit-taking outperform long positions. agentic_gptoss (+$34.30) succeeded by opening shorts and closing when 'position is already in profit' rather than holding.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-16

### Moderate Bearish

**Recommended approach** (80% confidence, seen 1x):
> Asset selection matters: DOGE (-3%) showed highest volatility/decline, making it best short target. BNB (-0.61%) showed relative strength, making it worst short target.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-16

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (74% confidence, seen 2x):
> Active trading with 120-200 trades/24h, multi-timeframe bullish alignment WITH explicit risk validation (2% equity, 2:1 R:R), proactive position management closing losers quickly. skill_aware_oss achieved +$1236.81 with this approach in +2.5% to +6.2% market
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (72% confidence, seen 1x):
> Optimal trade frequency 120-200 trades/24h. Below 50 misses opportunities (ta_baseline -$25.88), above 240 leads to overtrading losses (llama4_scout -$18.95)
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (70% confidence, seen 1x):

- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (70% confidence, seen 1x):

- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (68% confidence, seen 1x):
> Active trading with 120-200 trades/24h, multi-timeframe bullish alignment, explicit risk validation (2% risk, 2:1 reward), and proactive position management. skill_aware_oss (+$1379.66) and agentic_gptoss (+$689.63) demonstrate this approach works when market is up 2.78-6.44% across all assets.

- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (68% confidence, seen 1x):

- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (65% confidence, seen 1x):

- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (60% confidence, seen 1x):
> Multi-timeframe bullish alignment WITH risk validation and position scaling works in genuine uptrends (+3-5%). Moderate trade frequency (150-200) captures moves without overtrading. Focus on strongest movers (ETH, DOGE) not laggards (SOL).
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (60% confidence, seen 1x):
> Position sizing at 25% equity limit per position (gptoss_20b_simple reasoning) allows meaningful exposure while maintaining diversification. gptoss_20b_simple achieved +$27.88 with 124 trades using this approach.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Trending Up

**Recommended approach** (55% confidence, seen 1x):
> Active loss management - closing losing positions quickly to free margin for winners. agentic_gptoss and gptoss_120b_simple both used this successfully.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Sideways Flat

**Recommended approach** (52% confidence, seen 1x):
> Reduce trade frequency to <10 trades/day; passive index allocation outperforms active trading; avoid leveraged positions entirely; wait for clear directional breakout before engaging
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-13

### Moderate Bull

**Recommended approach** (50% confidence, seen 1x):
> Zero-trade strategies (gpt_simple, index_fund) preserve capital but miss +3-5% opportunities. In confirmed uptrends, some participation is optimal.
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-14

### Low Volatility Mixed

**Recommended approach** (48% confidence, seen 1x):
> When all assets show <0.1% absolute movement, avoid opening new positions; fee drag exceeds potential profit; technical signals (SMA, MACD, multi-timeframe alignment) produce false signals in this regime
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-13

### Sideways Flat

**Recommended approach** (45% confidence, seen 1x):
> Mean-reversion and momentum strategies both fail; only capital preservation strategies (hold cash, minimal index allocation) succeed
- Total observations: 0
- First identified: 2026-01-13
