## Key Learnings

1. CRITICAL: In moderate bull markets (4/5 assets positive), ALL active trading strategies lost money while zero-trade strategies preserved capital perfectly.
2. Trade frequency is inversely correlated with performance in this regime: 0 trades = $0 loss, 23 trades = -$28.69, 243 trades = -$229.00.
3. Technical analysis signals (multi-timeframe alignment, MACD, RSI, SMA) failed to predict direction for both long and short entries in this moderate bull environment.
4. Asset selection mattered significantly: BNB (+2.03%) vs SOL (-0.09%). Agents fixating on SOL 'uptrend' (llama4_scout) suffered worst losses.
5. Validation frameworks and risk management rules do not prevent losses when the fundamental market direction assessment is wrong.
6. High-confidence decisions (0.85-0.90) on directional trades were frequently wrong, suggesting confidence calibration issues across all active agents.
7. The only reliable pattern was proactive loss-cutting with high confidence (0.85-0.95) to limit drawdown.

  - Conf: 92%, N=180, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Repeated high-confidence long entries on SOLUSDT based on 'strong uptrend' reasoning while asset actually declined -0.09%. llama4_scout opened multiple longs at 0.80-0.90 confidence citing +2.24% to +2.59% price increases that were temporary.
  - Conf: 92%, N=7, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Multi-timeframe bullish alignment signals (15m, 1h, 4h) produce losses in bearish markets. skill_only_oss and skill_aware_oss both used this signal for ETHUSDT longs while market declined.
  - Conf: 90%, N=191, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Negative funding rate interpreted as long opportunity signal is unreliable. llama4_scout: 'funding rate is slightly negative which could indicate a potential long opportunity' - total PnL -$192.40.
  - Conf: 90%, N=180, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Multi-timeframe bearish alignment signals for short entry FAIL in bullish markets. skill_aware_oss opened shorts on 'bearish bias (RSI overbought, MACD bearish)' but market moved up, causing -$173.25 loss.
  - Conf: 90%, N=355, seen 1x

  - Conf: 90%, N=2, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Opening longs based on 'positive momentum' or small price increases (+0.33% to +0.44%) during overall bearish market conditions. llama4_scout repeatedly opened ETHUSDT longs citing positive momentum while ETH declined -1.29%.
  - Conf: 88%, N=76, seen 1x

  - Conf: 88%, N=377, seen 1x

- **AVOID**: High trade frequency (129-195 trades) with GPT-based models all resulted in significant losses ($-55 to $-128) despite validation steps and risk management frameworks.

  - Conf: 87%, N=173, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Anticipating breakouts on 'relatively stable' assets with small movements is unreliable. llama4_scout opened long on ETHUSDT expecting 'potential breakout' on -0.03% movement.
  - Conf: 85%, N=180, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Position sizing at 25% equity with 5x leverage on directionally wrong trades amplifies losses. gptoss_20b_simple lost -$175.85 with 131 trades.
  - Conf: 85%, N=131, seen 1x

  - Conf: 79%, N=494, seen 2x
- **AVOID**: Shorting based on negative funding rate alone is unreliable. gptoss_20b_simple shorted DOGEUSDT citing 'negative funding' but still lost $44.40 overall despite DOGE being down -3%.
  - Conf: 75%, N=84, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Extreme overtrading (248 trades in 24h) with high confidence (0.8-0.9) but shallow reasoning leads to losses. llama4_scout made 248 trades with -$18.95 PnL, using repetitive reasoning like 'showing strong upward trend' and 'high funding rate indicating potential for further growth' without validation checks.
  - Conf: 72%, N=248, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Zero-trade strategies (0 trades) miss significant opportunity cost in trending bull markets - gpt_simple and index_fund had $0 PnL while market gained +2.5% to +6.2%
  - Conf: 72%, N=502, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: High funding rate interpreted as bullish momentum signal is unreliable. llama4_scout repeatedly cites 'high funding rate, indicating potential for further growth' but loses money. High funding actually indicates crowded long positioning and potential reversal risk.
  - Conf: 70%, N=248, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Zero-trade strategies (gpt_simple, index_fund) preserve capital but miss significant gains in strong bull markets (+3-6% moves)

  - Conf: 68%, N=7, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Technical signals (SMA, MACD) without risk validation produce losses. skill_only_oss made 41 trades with -$77.63 PnL, likely using similar technical signals as skill_aware_oss but without the explicit risk validation layer that makes the difference.
  - Conf: 65%, N=41, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Extreme overtrading (248 trades in 24h) with repetitive single-asset focus (SOLUSDT) despite asset underperforming market (+1.55% vs ETH +4.96%). llama4_scout lost $69.19 repeatedly opening SOLUSDT longs.
  - Conf: 65%, N=248, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Technical analysis baseline (ta_baseline) with low trade frequency (21 trades) underperforms in trending markets - missed opportunity cost
  - Conf: 65%, N=21, seen 1x

  - Conf: 65%, N=21, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: High-confidence (0.8-0.9) entries based solely on 'strong uptrend' and 'high funding rate' without risk validation or position management leads to losses. llama4_scout used this reasoning 20+ times.
  - Conf: 63%, N=248, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Traditional TA baseline approach without adaptive risk management loses in trending markets. ta_baseline made 21 trades with -$25.88 PnL while market was up 2.78-6.44% across all assets - failing to capture obvious uptrend.
  - Conf: 63%, N=21, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Focusing on weakest-performing asset (SOLUSDT +1.55%) while ignoring strongest movers (ETHUSDT +4.96%, DOGEUSDT +4.77%) destroys alpha. llama4_scout exclusively traded SOL.
  - Conf: 60%, N=248, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Zero-trade strategies miss significant opportunities in strong trending markets. index_fund and gpt_simple made 0 trades and $0 PnL while market gained 2.78-6.44%. In bull markets, inaction is a losing strategy relative to active participation.
  - Conf: 60%, N=504, seen 1x

- **AVOID**: Very low trade frequency (<10 trades) with LLM-based agents suggests decision paralysis or overly conservative thresholds. learning_qwen (3 trades, $0) and qwen3_235b (4 trades, -$7.42) failed to capitalize on clear trending market.
  - Conf: 57%, N=7, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: High-confidence (0.85+) trades with multi-timeframe bullish/bearish alignment reasoning produce losses in flat markets - skill_aware_oss repeatedly opened positions with 0.85 confidence citing 'strong bullish alignment' yet lost $581
  - Conf: 53%, N=155, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Technical analysis baseline (ta_baseline) using traditional indicators loses $25.99 with only 18 trades in trending market. Pure TA without adaptive reasoning underperforms.
  - Conf: 52%, N=18, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Overtrading with 'excellent 2:1 risk/reward' reasoning repeatedly fails when market lacks directional movement - this justification appeared in multiple losing trades across skill_aware_oss and agentic_gptoss
  - Conf: 50%, N=629, seen 2x
- **AVOID**: Positive funding rate interpreted as bullish momentum signal leads to losses - llama4_scout repeatedly cited 'positive funding rate indicating potential upward momentum' while losing $326
  - Conf: 48%, N=225, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Conflicting directional signals on same asset within short timeframes indicates poor strategy - skill_aware_oss opened both long and short on BTCUSDT with same 0.85 confidence, showing signal unreliability
  - Conf: 45%, N=155, seen 1x
- **AVOID**: Mean-reversion strategies ('fading crowded longs', 'potential mean-reversion bounce') fail when market is truly flat with no significant deviation to revert from
  - Conf: 40%, N=6, seen 1x
